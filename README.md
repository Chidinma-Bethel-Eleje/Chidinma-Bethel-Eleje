- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Health-related data analysis projects, predictive modeling in healthcare, and open-source projects involving real-world datasets.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Best practices in machine learning model deployment and optimizing large health datasets for analysis.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual storytelling with data, or transitioning from a science background into data analytics.
